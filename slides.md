‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with my multi-tenancy approach‚Äù, was the question in this Reddit post I found some weeks ago...

![Reddit post about multi-million dollar app idea for a SaaS in Django](images/intro2.png)

???

...from a person that was intending to create a multi-million-dollar app in Django by means of adding multi-tenancy to a previously existing single-tenant project.

I felt quite identified with the redditer, since I myself had the same question a couple of years ago. And, despite the fact that I took a different approach than this person, it‚Äôs true that there‚Äôs more than this mate and me out in the ocean wondering what is wrong with the path they have taken, or are about take, when it comes to multi-tenancy in Django.

But anyways, I now feel in a much better position to answer this mate and myself of what was wrong then and what could still be wrong today.

# Of Django, PostgreSQL schemas<br/>and your multi-million dollar idea

So, if you‚Äôve ever woken up with a multi-million-dollar idea for a multi-tenancy project in Django, and you‚Äôve made the decision to do so through PostgreSQL schemas, this talk is definitely for you.

## Database approaches

---

**Isolated:**<br/>Multiple databases, one per tenant.

**Shared:**<br/>One database, tables scoped by tenant.

**Semi-isolated:**<br/>One database, one PostgreSQL schema per tenant.

---

layout: true

## PostgreSQL schemas

---

.left-column-66[

##### Schemas:.ref[1]

-   Layer between database and tables.
-   Equivalent to namespaces.
-   In the face of ambiguity, precedence is set through the **search path**.

##### Established packages:

-   [bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas](https://github.com/bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas)
-   [tomturner/django-tenants](https://github.com/tomturner/django-tenants)

--

##### My own experimental package:

-   [lorinkoz/django-pgschemas](https://github.com/tomturner/django-pgschemas)

---

##### The three cornerstones of the packages:

--

.box[Custom database backend to set the `search_path`]

--

.box[Custom `migrate` command to operate with schemas]

--

.box[Custom database router with `allow_migrate`]

# Why schemas?

--

-   Wait, there were other options?
-   Sense of security
-   Less burden of queries
-   Customization of tenants
-   Easier backup / restore flow of tenants
-   Hype

## Tenants, schemas and models

---

--

##### What is the Python representation of a tenant?

--

```python
# abstract_concept.py
tenant = Tenant(schema_name="schema_1")
```

--

```python
# models.py
class Tenant(models.Model):
    schema_name = models.CharField(unique=True, ...)
```

---

.box[üí° All tenants have an associated schema]

```python
# settings.py

SHARED_APPS = [...]
TENANT_APPS = [...]

INSTALLED_APPS = SHARED_APPS + TENANT_APPS

```

--

.box[ü§î Why at the app level and not at the model level?]

---

##### Tenant (private) models

.left-column[![Diagram of private model](images/private-model.png)]
.right-column[

-   Tenant specific models
-   Customizable catalogs

---

##### Shared models

.left-column[![Diagram of shared model](images/shared-model.png)]
.right-column[

-   The tenant catalog
-   Read-only catalogs
-   System-wide data
-   Cached aggregations

---

##### Duplicated (hidden) models

.left-column[![Diagram of hidden model](images/hidden-model.png)]

`django.contrib.sessions`

-   Source of leaking authentication.
-   Must be equally strict or stricter than users.

## Moving models between schemas

---

--

We are using the `allow_migrate` of a database router.

--

.box[üí° Migrations are still recorded as being applied]

--

.warning[‚ö†Ô∏è Migrations must be reapplied differently]

---

##### Strategy:

-   Unapply migrations of the app.
-   Change "app to schema" configuration.
-   Apply migrations of the app again.

--

## Tenant creation is slow

---

--

##### Why?

-   Schema creation implies running all migrations from zero.
-   Migration history is not necessarily optimal.
-   Additional data initialization can take time.

--

## Zero downtime deployments

---

--

.box[ü¶â Make your code resilient]

--

##### Culture:

-   Embrace multi-phase deployments.
-   Always make migrations reversible.
-   Be prepared to reverse migrations.

---

##### Strategy:

-   Change code to handle both old and new DB structure.
-   Mutate DB structure.
-   Update code for new DB structure alone.

## Other middle-term challenges

---

---

-   Data recollection across tenants.
-   Backup / restore flow of tenants with free users.
-   What to do with unique, general purpose tenants like a master site, a blog or the help center.

---

--

.center[![Joke with vessels falling off the end of the sea](images/uncharted-territories.png)]

---

.box[ü§ì Let's try it in the Django side]

--

##### Strategy:

-   Schemas will be the minimum decomposable unit.
-   Physical shards must be routed along with schemas.

--

```python
tenant = Tenant(schema_name="schema_1", logical_shard=1)

database = get_physical_shard_from_tenant(tenant)

```

---

```python
class ShardedSchemasDatabaseRouter:

    def db_for_read(model, ...):
        # Physical shard as default value
        ...

    def db_for_write(model, ...):
        # Physical shard as default value
        ...

    def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name, ...):
        # Same implementation of the selected package
        ...
